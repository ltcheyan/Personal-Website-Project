Lucas Tcheyan's Website Project

Planning:

This website is meant to provide visitors with a short overview of my personal and professional interests. The website will feature three distinct sections, each one highlighting a different aspect of my life - an experience page, a publications page, and a NFT page. See below for specifics about each page's contents.

Table of Contents:
About Page - Welcomes visitor and provides an overview of personal and professional interests. 
Experience Page - Highlights recent professional expereinces - i.e. a short resume for recruiters. 
Publications - Highlights my most recent publications and links to their original publication page. 
NFTs - Highlights images of my favorite NFTs.
