Lucas Tcheyan's Website Project

Planning:

This website is meant to provide visitors with a short overview of my personal and professional interests. The website will feature three distinct sections, each one highlighting a different aspect of my life - specifically a general "about" page, an experience page, a publications page, and a NFT page. See below for specifics about each page's contents.

About Page: Welcomes visitor and provides an overview of personal and professional interests. 
Experience Page: Highlights recent professional expereinces - i.e. a short resume for recruiters. 
Publications: Highlights my most recent publications and links to their original publication page. 
NFTs: Highlights images of my favorite NFTs.

Thank you to Professor Rosetti for intial inspiration for the website page (https://prof-rossetti.org/) and to Mark Otto/Jacob Thornton for their original design and bootstrap (https://startbootstrap.com/theme/resume). Start Bootstrap is based on the [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) framework created by [Mark Otto](https://twitter.com/mdo) and [Jacob Thorton](https://twitter.com/fat).

Code for the "NFTS" section was bootstrapped and modified from https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/examples/album/.

Thank you also to classmate Paul Kassar for consultations and assistance throughout the implementation process. Paul made himself available throughout to troubleshoot and fix code errors.
