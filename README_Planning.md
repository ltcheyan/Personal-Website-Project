Lucas Tcheyan's Website Project

Planning:

This website is meant to provide visitors with a short overview of my personal and professional interests. The website will feature three distinct sections, each one highlighting a different aspect of my interests - specifically a general "about" page, an experience page, a publications page, and a NFT page. See below for specifics about each page's contents.

About Page: Provides an overview of personal and professional interests. 
Experience Page: Highlights recent professional expereinces - an abridged resume. 
Publications: Highlights my most recent publications and links to their original publication page. 
NFTs: Highlights my favorite NFTs.
